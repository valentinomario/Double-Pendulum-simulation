#Double Pendulum simulation

In this project, I am simulating a system consisting of multiple double pendulums starting from almost the same initial conditions. The masses are located at the extremities, so the bars are considered mass free, and the rotational friction is considered zero.
Run *“DoublePendulum.m”* to start the simulation.
